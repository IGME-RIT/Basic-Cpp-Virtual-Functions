    virtual void PrintClass() = 0;  // The virtual keyword makes it so that this function can be overriden.
    void PrintStats();              // Normally, a subclass could define the same function, and the one that is called will depend
                                    // On what variable it's being used as at the time. With virtual functions, the derived
                                    // classes function will always be used instead. This is helpful when we want to use a generic
                                    // variable to contain a less generic one.

                                    // = 0; defines this function to be pure virtual.
                                    // This means that the character class will not give any definition for the function.
                                    // Because of this, every derived class will be required to override this function.
                                    // It also makes it impossible to have an object of type Character,
                                    // because then calling the function would be impossible.
